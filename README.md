The Antoine equation is a class of semi-empirical correlations describing the relation between vapor pressure and temperature for pure substances.
The Antoine equation is derived from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. The equation was presented in 1888 by the French engineer Louis Charles Antoine [fr] (1825–1897).[1]

Validity range:
Usually, the Antoine equation cannot be used to describe the entire saturated vapour pressure curve from the triple point to the critical point,
because it is not flexible enough. Therefore, multiple parameter sets for a single component are commonly used.
A low-pressure parameter set is used to describe the vapour pressure curve up to the normal boiling point and the second set of parameters is used for
the range from the normal boiling point to the critical point.
